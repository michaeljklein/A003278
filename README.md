# A003278

Study of the series [A003278](http://oeis.org/A003278):

```
Szekeres's sequence: a(n)-1 in ternary = n-1 in binary; also:
a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(n) is smallest number k which avoids any
3-term arithmetic progression in a(1), a(2), ..., a(n-1), k.
```

Series analysis:

- Finite differences
- Finding cycles
- Finding arithmetic progressions
- Division and remainder finite-difference-like transformation on a series

Calculation:

- Calculating A003278
- Performance analysis and several implementations
